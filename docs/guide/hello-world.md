# Hello World
As a first contact with Carmentis, we propose a "Hello World" application. This demonstration is easy to install
and is specifically designed for learning purposes. The source code and the installation instructions
are accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/Carmentis/carmentis-app-hello-world). The goal is to construct a 
publicly-available messaging board, in which anyone can post a message, later being displayed in the public board.

## Installation

### Step 1: Installing NodeJS and NPM
This "Hello World" application has been developed using NodeJS that should be installed in your system. The installation
of NodeJS (as well as `npm`) depends on your system in configuration, we refer to the official NodeJS installation page
([here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)).

### Step 2: Installing and Configuring Your Wallet
To agree on the sending of your message, you will relies on digital signature, authenticating the message your are sending
in the board. Don't worry, in this tutorial and even the others, no signature key pair generation is required, it is
completely transparent for you, thanks to the [wallet of Carmentis](./wallet.md).

The wallet of Carmentis takes the form of an extension in your browser, from which every approval steps is based.
We refer you to the installation guide ([here](./wallet.md#wallet-installation)) to install the wallet in your favorite browser.

Once installed, you have to create your personal account (which is ultimately your signature key pair). Again, we refer
you to the wallet configuration page in the documentation ([here](./wallet.md#wallet-configuration)).
To verify that your account has been successfully created, try to authenticate yourself at login page of Carmentis ([here](https://data.testapps.carmentis.io/workspace/sign-in)).

### Step 3: Create your application in the Carmentis workspace
To interact with the system of Carmentis (including the already running operator, the blockchain and so on), it is
necessary to declare your application in your [personnal workspace](https://data.testapps.carmentis.io/workspace).
Note that if you are not logged in already, you will be automatically redirected to the login page.

Observe on the left of the workspace page, the "Applications" section as shown below:

![carmentis-workspace](/img/workspace-nav.png)


Create a new application using the `New` button and insert a name of your choice (the name you provide is not relevant).
For simplicity, assume that our application is called "Hello World".
A new row describing your freshly created application should appear.  Click in the Edit field as shown below:


![carmentis-list-applications](/img/list-applications.png)


At this point, your application is declared to Carmentis, but you must specify now *what* Carmentis is supposed to deal with,
namely your data. For the "Hello World" application, three (public) fields have to be declared:
- `Date` of type `string`
- `Sender` of type `string`
- `Message` of type `string`

To declare these three fields, go to the `Fields` section and for each of them, click on `New Field`, enter the name of
the field (**Note: every field's name is case-sensitive**), made it public by clicking on `Public Data` and finalize
using the `Confirm` button. Once all fields have been declared, you should obtain the following (the order of the variables is not relevant):


![carmentis-workspace-application-fields](/img/application-fields.png)


Then, move to the `Messages` section. These messages are used by Carmentis during the approval step by sending this
message directly to the user. These messages allow some flexibility but we voluntarily keep the message simple.
Add a new message by clicking on the `New message` button, put `approvalMessage` as the name of your message, and a message of your choice.
Suppose we have written `Do you agree?`. To learn more about messages, we refer you to the documentation ([here](https://docs.carmentis.io/docs/application/message)).

Finally, click on `Publish` to finalize the declaration of the application. In the `Overview` section is displayed the
ID of your application as well as the version number.

:::note
 The ID of your application is set once and never change. Nevertheless, you are still allowed to apply modification
 to your application: The publication of an updated application leads to an incrementation of the application's version
 number. To use the updated application, only update the version number to match the latest version.
:::

### Step 4: Configuring the environment variables
In the `.env.example` file, some variables has to be modified carefully. First, duplicate the `.env.example` file and
rename the duplicated file as `.env`. Only two variables has to be modified, namely `CARMENTIS_APPLICATION_ID` and `CARMENTIS_APPLICATION_VERSION`.

:::note 
The `CARMENTIS_APPLICATION_ID` and `CARMENTIS_APPLICATION_VERSION` values are displayed in your workspace
 ([here](https://data.testapps.carmentis.io/workspace/applications)) in your application under the `Overview` section.
:::
### Step 5: Launching the application server
Launching the NodeJS web server (which is our application) is done with the following command:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
    ```shell
    nmp install && node app.mjs
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
     TODO
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can observe that everything works by looking at the address specified in the `.env` file (by default, it is `http://localhost:3000`).
Once in your browser, observe the "Operator" and "Wallet" notifications, which should be **green** as shown below:

![all-checks.png](/img/all-checks.png)


## Hello World Usage
The Hello World application starts at the default web page consisting of a form block and a list of approved messages.
In the form, one enters a name (which is not necessarily tied to your real identity) and a message of its choice.

By clicking on the submit button, an approval popup will show up to ask you to approve your message.
Following the instruction, the page will be refreshed automatically with your message being displayed.
Why not looking online to observe your message in the blockchain using the [blochain explorer)](https://data.testapps.carmentis.io/explorer)?




:::danger HTTPS Requirements
The NodeJS server implementing the Hello World application requires a HTTPS connection to work, and hence a 
domain name.
